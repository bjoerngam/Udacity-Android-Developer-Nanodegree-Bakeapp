<b> Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project Number 3 </b>

In this app we had to display different recipes in a baking app. The JSON recipes data
contains the ingredients, the single steps, images and videos for each recipe. 

For playing the videos we used the ExoPlayer and also the UI was costumized for the 
tabet and the smartphones.
